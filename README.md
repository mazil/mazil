## Hullo hullo!

I'm a product designer and ethusiastic front-end coder. I love designing nice (and impactful) user experiences and poking around in HTML, CSS and JS.

👩🏻‍💻 **I'm currently looking for a new role** as a product/UX/UI designer at a mid-sized product company. You can [check out my website](https://masnibennett.com) for some examples of my work.

You can also find me in a few other places:
